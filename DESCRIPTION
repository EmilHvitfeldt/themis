Description: A dataset with an uneven number of cases in each class is said to 
    be unbalanced. Many models produce a subpar performance on unbalanced 
    datasets. A dataset can be balanced by increasing the number of minority 
    cases using  SMOTE <arXiv:1106.1813>, BorderlineSMOTE and ADASYN. Or by 
    decreasing the number of majority cases using NearMiss or Tomek link 
    removal.
